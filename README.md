# Practical-SQL-project-mavenmovies-
In this Project, we'll play the role of a business owner who just acquired Maven Movies, a brick and mortar DVD rental shop. Using only a Microsoft SQL Server database, our job is to learn everything we can about our new business, including inventory, staff, and customer behavior.
